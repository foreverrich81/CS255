The DriverPass project involved creating a system to help students prepare for their driving tests by offering online practice exams and scheduling behind‑the‑wheel training. The client is a small driving‑school business represented by the owner, Liam, along with support from the secretary and the IT officer. They needed a system that could manage user accounts, schedule lessons, provide online practice tests, track training packages, process payments, generate reports, and stay updated with DMV requirements. The goal was to build a platform that improved the student learning experience, supported instructors in managing lessons, and streamlined the daily operations of the business.

I beleive I did a good job keeping things clear and easy to understand. I showed that I understand how the DriverPass system works, and I was able to explain it in simple language. I like the various charts that I created and that they are fiarly simple to read and understand. I beleive I stayed on point and created a good overall project.

A part of my work that would be worth revising would be the presentation portion. I could use some introduction and closing statements along with smoother transitions. There are also a few explanations that could be made clearer by tightening the wording and focusing more directly on the main point. 

I identified what each stakeholder needed and turned those needs into clear system features. Students wanted easier access to practice tests, the owner wanted better scheduling control, the secretary needed simpler appointment management, and the IT officer focused on security and reliability. I converted these needs into functions like lesson scheduling, online practice tests, activity logs, reports, and role‑based permissions, and used UML diagrams to show how all the parts of the system fit together for each user type.

Considering user needs means designing a system that is practical, easy to use, and able to solve the real problems people face. When the design is based on what users actually do, the system fits their workflows, supports their daily tasks, reduces mistakes, and helps the business run more smoothly. It also keeps development focused on features that matter instead of wasting time on things no one will use. A system built around user needs is more likely to be accepted and trusted.

A strong design process starts with understanding the people who will use or support the system. Understanding their goals, frustrations, workflows, and limits. That information is then turned into clear requirements that explain what the system must do and how it should behave. Those requirements then guide the creation of diagrams, models, and early prototypes that show how the system will work. To support this process, I can analyze users and stakeholders to understand real needs, write use cases and user stories to map out interactions, and use UML diagrams to visualize structure and workflows. I can then also refine early designs through feedback, building simple prototypes to test ideas quickly, and validate requirements to make sure they are clear, testable, and aligned with what users actually need.

There are several strategies taht could help me design better systems in the future. Start by focusing on the user’s workflow so the design reflects real tasks instead of forcing users to adapt to the technology. Break the system into smaller parts with specific purposes to keep everything organized and easier to manage. Use diagrams early to spot gaps or conflicts before development begins, and keep requirements simple and specific so they’re easy to understand. Reviewing my work with others will help confirm that I interpreted the users' needs correctly, and refining my design as I go improves clarity, structure, and usability. Together, these strategies help you create systems that are both technically strong and easy for people to use.
